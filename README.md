# ALGORITHM EXERCISE

Â¡The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the box office of the cinema in a huge row. Each of them has a single bill of 100, 50 or 25 dollars. A "The Avengers" ticket costs $ 25.

Vania is currently working as an employee and she wants to sell a ticket to each person in

the row.

Will Vania be able to sell a ticket to each person and give change / change if initially she does not have money and sell tickets strictly in the order of the queue of people?


Return YES, if Vania can sell a ticket to each person and give change / change with it

money you have on hand at the time. Otherwise, return NO.

Example:

tickets ([25, 25, 50]) // => YES

tickets ([25, 100]) // => NO. Vania will not have enough money to give change / return to the

100 dollars

tickets ([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) // => NO. Vania will not have enough money to give 75 dollars

change / change (you cannot create two 25 bills from one 50 bill)
